### Purpose ###
The Forth Foundation Library (FFL) is a library written in the Forth programming language. It contains multiple modules with generally applicable source code. Its main purpose is to make it easier to develop applications.

### Forth ###
Refer to the Forth [FIG](http://www.fig-uk.org), [Wiki](http://wiki.forthfreak.net) or [FAQ](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/computer-lang/forth-faq) for more information about the Forth language.

### Modules ###
The modules in the library are divided in six groups:

| **Data types** | **Collections** | **Hash & RNG** | **Interfaces** | **Development** | **Compound** |
|:---------------|:----------------|:---------------|:---------------|:----------------|:-------------|
| Bit Array | Array | CRC-32 | Interval Timer | ANS Structures | Text Input Stream |
| Character | Single Linked List | MD-5 | Argument Parser | Escaped String | Text Output Stream |
| Dynamic String | Double Linked List | SHA-1 | Gettexts mo-file Import | Enumeration | Regular Expressions |
| Character Set | Hash Table | SHA-256 | XML/HTML Parser | String Table | XML-DOM |
| Date Time | Binary Tree | Mersenne Twister | XML/HTML Writer | Unit Test | DateTime Output Stream |
| Complex Number | AVL Tree | Distributed | GTK-server | Fixed width data types | Message Catalog |
| Fraction | N-Tree |  |  |  |  |

See the [Modules](Modules.md) wiki page for an overview of all modules in the library. These pages are also distributed in the download package.

### Manual ###
In the [Manual](Manual.md) wiki page there is hands on information how to use the library. In the [Engines](Engines.md) page you can check if your Forth engine is supported by the library.

### Package ###
The download package includes the library, test programs, example programs and configuration files for a number of Forth engines and can be found on the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/ffl/downloads/list) tab.

### License ###
Since version 0.9.0 the library may be freely distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License, the test programs and examples under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

### Releases ###
About once a year a new version will be published on this site, as stated in the [Roadmap](Roadmap.md) page. This will also be announced on [Freshmeat](http://freshmeat.net) and
[comp.lang.forth](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.forth).
